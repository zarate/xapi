	* <p>Searches for items in the given folder path.</p>
	* <p>Similar to [xa.Folder.copy()], you can exclude items from the search using a [xa.filters.IFilter] instance. See predefined filters in [xa.Filter].
	* The filter function will get called once per item, receiving the path of each item. It should return true to include the item in the
	* search result or false otherwise. You can use predefined filters or roll your own implementing [xa.filters.IFilter].</p>
	* <p>Default filter is [xa.filters.All].
	* <p>The search is fully recursive by default (deep = -1). To search <strong>only</strong> the items in the root of the folder, pass 0 for the deep parameter.
	* If you want to search for items in the root and the next level, pass 1. To search for items in root + first and second levels, past 2, etc.</p>
